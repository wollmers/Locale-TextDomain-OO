Revision history for Perl extension Locale::Text::Domain:OO.

1.000 Thu Dec 19 17:42:56 2013
- Compleately rewritten.
  The main idea is that the lexicon can load during compile time.
  The next thing is that the HTTP request or the OS is compleately untouched.
  If someone need that connection he is able to do that by himself.
  The binding to Locale::TextDomain internal module is no longer used.
